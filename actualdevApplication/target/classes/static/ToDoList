Demo application version 2.0
The file is written for my colleagues in order to realise what was done and what has to be done

!!!First thing to notice -> There are no comments by now, however the methods and variables are named in the most explicit way.
you can easily understand what's going on.

WHAT WAS DONE BY NOW???
1. CRUD functionality for STOCKS (this will be the general product that will be available for all users)
What is it for?
-products can be created by any user in order to develop the general product of the application
-these can be seen by all users in order to be able to pick something for his own product

2. CRUD functionality for USERS (by now this is an inmemory variant without security)
What is it for?
-new users can be "registered"
-each user from the beginning has an empty "ownstock"

3 CRUD functionality for UserStocks (this is pretty much finished)
What is it for?
-user can manipulate with his own products

WHAT HAS TO BE DONE FURTHER??

1. We need to add validators in the Service classes (ex: user should be able to add his own products only if these are present in general product)
2. We need to create 2 more (at least) CRUD functionalities by now
    - UserRecipe
    - UserMenu
3. Even though you may find an HTML file, it is not yet used. We have to integrate our front
